# Welcome to the OpenProof GitHub Repos!  

**OpenProof** is tackling the **blockchain trilemma**—scaling blockchain networks without sacrificing decentralization or security. With over 20 years of expertise in **storage ASIC system design**, we’re bringing innovative solutions to the blockchain world.  

## What We Do  
We’ve developed **ZKPU**, a zero-knowledge proof accelerator that redefines blockchain scalability:  
- **Decentralization First:** Native NVMe support enables universal compatibility and broader network participation.  
- **Unmatched Performance:** Drastically reduces proof generation times and power consumption.  
- **Open-Source Collaboration:** Built on UC Berkeley’s Chipyard project with a configurable RISC-V CPU for adaptability to evolving protocols.  

## What’s Next  
At OpenProof, we believe in the power of collaboration and transparency. Our commitment to open-source innovation doesn’t stop with ZKPU.  
Stay tuned—**more open-source projects are coming** to further empower the blockchain ecosystem and advance decentralization.
